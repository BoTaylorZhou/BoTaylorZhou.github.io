# 🐇 About me

I'm a professor of [School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://math.cqjtu.edu.cn/), [Chongqing Jiaotong University](https://www.cqjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, my research interest includes AI for Transport and AI for rational inattention. In the past, I have conducted research in the area of stability theory of neural networks, event-triggered control and distributed optimization. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Qiankun Song](https://www.sciencedirect.com/author/7202973716/qiankun-song) for pursuing master's degree of Computer Science in [Chongqing Jiaotong University](https://www.cqjtu.edu.cn/), and Prof. [Xiaofeng Liao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VpAZWLIAAAAJ&hl=en) for pursuing doctor's degree of applied mathematics in [Southwest University](https://www.swu.edu.cn/). I am also very fortunate to visit Prof. [Tingwen Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NNJBCaAAAAAJ&hl=en) in Science Progam, Texas A&M University at Qatar and Prof. [Ronghui Liu](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/951/professor-ronghui-liu) in Institute of Transport Studies, University of Leeds.
